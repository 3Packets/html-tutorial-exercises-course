# `09` Formatting Text

The way word processing works in documents is pretty standard, you always see the same stuff: Headings, bold text, paragraphs, quotes, etc.

HTML was meant to replicate that exact behavior. Here is and example of a typical document that can be replicated with it:

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please write the code to replicate the exact same styles of the previous image with pure html, use headings, paragraph, strong, blockquote, ul and li.

## 💡 Hints:

+ You should not add any CSS.

+ For the `<blockquote>` case, the stylings have been already applied in the same file.
