# `07` Same Page

Anchors (`<a>`) are also capable to scroll the user through the website to a specific element within it.

To do that, you have to assign an `ID` to the element you want to scroll to, and then, set the `URL` of the anchor `<a>` to that `ID` you have assigned before, prepended by a "`#`" character, like this:

```html
<a href="#element_id"></a>
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create 2 anchors `<a>`, one that scrolls the user to the **end** of the website and another one that sends the user to the **beginning** of the website.

## 💡 Hint:

+ The only way so use anchors like this, is with the "`ID`" of the elements, there is no other way.
