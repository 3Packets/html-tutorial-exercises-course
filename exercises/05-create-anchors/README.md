# `05` Create anchors 

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Add to the website `<body>` an anchor `<a>` tag that says: `Click me to search on google`

2. The anchor (`<a>`) should take the user to the url [http://google.com](http://google.com) when it is clicked.

## 💻 Expected Result:

## 💡 Hints:

+ Your code shoud be something like this:

```md
<a href="url">--your text--</a>
```

+ Read about absolute vs relative paths here: [http://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/](http://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/)

## 🔎 Important:

+ The given `url` is an ABSOLUTE path because it starts with "http", that means that you are telling the browser that you are going to be taking the user OUTSIDE of your website.
